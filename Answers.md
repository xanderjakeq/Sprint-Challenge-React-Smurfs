1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Client-Side routing is where the client(app) handles the url route based on user
    interaction and render data depending on the url and does not make requests to the server 
    every time the url changes. Serverside routing is where the server requests are handled by
    the browser and make requests to it every time the url changes. It only renders what it gets
    from the server and minimal work is done on the client.
